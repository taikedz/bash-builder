# Integration/Regression tests

Some quick tests to ensure the sanity of a new build.

Relies on scripts being in the main "bin-candidates". Should not be run manually, but part of the ./build.sh in the root of the repo.

These tests are to ensure that individual features of build are triggered, not to test sub-libraries themselves.
