# Todo

* pre-build bbuild for distribution. Simply building from the dependencies on-install is insane
    * installer should only optionally pull in bash-libs ; support to do it automatically should still be an option though
* add an installation path for supporting-libs (`~/.local/lib/bbuild/bb` for example) that are of specific concern to bash-builder operation
* change `bbuild` argument logic: `bbuild SOURCE DEST`
* change `bbuildrc` to a sequence of custom commands

    # bbuildrc file

    shellcheck on

    buildto ./bin src/main.sh src/supporting.sh
